\# Immigrant Management System (Backend) - Readme

The Immigrant Management System is a web service backend that facilitates the management of immigrants. It provides APIs for creating, retrieving, and managing immigrant data, as well as handling feedback and notifications. The backend is built using the Go programming language and utilizes MongoDB as the database for data storage.

\## Features

- Create new immigrant records with details such as name, passport number, email, gender, country, age, arrival date, stay time, and visa type.
- Retrieve a list of all immigrants, approved immigrants, pending immigrants, and rejected immigrants.
- Approve or reject pending immigrants.
- Collect feedback from immigrants, including comments and ratings.
- Send and retrieve notifications for immigrants.

\## Technology Stack

- Programming Language: Go (Golang)
- Database: MongoDB

\## Setup and Installation

1. Ensure you have Go and MongoDB installed on your system.
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
1. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to start the backend server:

\```bash

go run main.go

\```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8080` by default. If you wish to change the port, set the `PORT` environment variable before running the server.

1. Make sure your MongoDB database is running, and the connection string is correctly configured in `config/connection.go` (connection string defined in `const connectionstring`).

\## API Endpoints

The following are the available API endpoints for this backend web service:

- \*\*POST\*\* `/immigrants`: Create a new immigrant record.
- \*\*GET\*\* `/immigrants`: Retrieve a list of all immigrants.
- \*\*GET\*\* `/immigrants/approved`: Retrieve a list of approved immigrants.
- \*\*GET\*\* `/immigrants/pending`: Retrieve a list of pending immigrants.
- \*\*GET\*\* `/immigrants/rejected`: Retrieve a list of rejected immigrants.
- \*\*PUT\*\* `/immigrants/accept/{passportno}`: Approve an immigrant by passport number.
- \*\*POST\*\* `/feedback`: Create feedback for an immigrant.
- \*\*GET\*\* `/notifications`: Retrieve notifications for an immigrant.

\## Database Configuration

The backend connects to a MongoDB database for data storage. The database connection string is defined in `config/connection.go`. Ensure that you have the correct MongoDB connection string configured to connect to your MongoDB cluster.

\## Controller Logic

The `controller` package contains the business logic for handling various HTTP requests and processing data. The logic is implemented in separate functions for each API endpoint.

\## Hosting

The backend web service is hosted on Render. To deploy the backend, follow these steps:

1. Set up an account on Render (https://render.com/) and create a new web service for Go.
1. Link the web service to your GitHub repository containing the Immigrant Management System backend code.
1. Render will automatically detect the Go application and build it.
1. After a successful build, the backend web service will be deployed and accessible via the provided URL.
